Tree of life children Ministries Ugandan Orphanage was conceptualized when the Director of the organization realized his dreams of trying to be able to support children who are socially alienated as a result of losing their parents due to AIDS. He is using Tree of life children ministries as a way to help children that find themselves in this predicament (an unpleasantly, difficult or dangerous situation). Most of these children are expelled from their households because other family members deem them unclean andi contagious. Many members of the external families are usually not financially stable and can not care for these children. Some parents are single  mothers because of separation they become drunkards end up  beating theses children and they  run away from their homes, some are bewitched go mad for the powers of God we pray for them they become settled in their souls come normal again.This was a common practice in the communities he lived and worked in his home country Uganda. For socially displaced infants with no moral support, life becomes very challenging at such an early stage. <>This is the reason why the Director, who has dealt with these situations, is now lending a House to the many children whose fate can be changed through this Organization
