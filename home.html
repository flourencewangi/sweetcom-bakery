            Biscuit, in the United States, a small quick bread usually made from flour, salt, and butter or vegetable shortening, with baking powder as a leavening agent. The dough is kneaded briefly and rolled out, and the biscuits are cut with a round cutter. The dough may also be dropped by spoonfuls for an irregular shape. Biscuits are usually eaten hot with butter and fruit preserves, sausage gravy, or ham. They are especially associated with the American South.
